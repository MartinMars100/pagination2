Pagination and Content Filter Project
This is the second project of my Techdegree program


The website displays a list of all students that have been
hardcoded into a html file.
If the user has a js enabled browser, then the javascript code
will load 10 students at a time with a page selector at the bottom,
The js code also loads a searchbox that allows for searching the 
student file for a particular string of characters.
A simple animation written in js creates a fade in of the student list
whenever it changes or loads for the first time.
